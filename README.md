README: Multi-source Chat App with LangChain Integration
Introduction
Welcome to the Multi-source Chat App, a project that integrates data from three different sources - LangChain, a local database, and Google API. This chat application leverages LangChain's flexible abstractions and extensive toolkit to build a context-aware and reasoning language model (LLM) application.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a chat application that enriches user interactions by sourcing information from diverse channels. Users can engage in conversations where the application seamlessly integrates data from LangChain, a local database, and the Google API to provide comprehensive and context-aware responses.

Features
LangChain Integration: Harness the power of LangChain's extensive toolkit to build context-aware language applications. Leverage LangChain's flexible abstractions for reasoning and understanding in the chat application.

Multi-source Data Integration: The chat app integrates data from three different sources:

LangChain: Utilizes LangChain for advanced language processing and understanding.
Local Database: Incorporates data from a local database for personalized and contextual information.
Google API: Fetches real-time data from Google API to enhance the breadth and accuracy of information.
User-friendly Interface: The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless communication. Users can interact with the chat interface and receive responses enriched with information from multiple sources.

Context-aware Responses: The app is designed to provide context-aware responses by analyzing user input and utilizing information from LangChain, the local database, and Google API. This ensures a more personalized and relevant user experience.
